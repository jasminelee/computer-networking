ICN 8.1: Intro to Network Attacks
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): used to discover the link layer address, e.g. MAC address, associated with a given network layer address, e.g. IPv4
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): used on UDP/IP networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address to each device on a network
- Security essentials:
    - secrecy/confidentiality: no one can listen in to our communication. solved via encryption
    - integrity. ensures communication wasn't tampered with. solved via message authentication codes (MACs)
    - authenticity. can I be sure the other party I'm talking to is who they say they are? solved via digital signatures and certs
    - uninterrupted communication
- Security compromises:
    - eavesdrop. passively "sniff" and record network data
        - listen to wifi using wireshark bc packets are broadcasted for everyone to hear
        - compromise a router to duplicate and forward data
        - man-in-the-middle attacks are hard to detect bc both parties can think they're talking to a legitimate end host
    - tamper with data
        - changing contents of packets, redirecting packets, or taking control of end-host
    - prevent communication - 'denial of service'

ICN 8.2: Attacks at Layer 2
- common attacks:
    - eavesdropping with an interface in promiscuous mode, a mode at which every data packet transmitted is received and read by every network adapter.
    - force packets to be broadcast
    - masquerade as DHCP or ARP server. redirect packets to a different end-host
- wifi is broadcast into the air for everyone to hear
- ethernet uses switches. media access control (MAC) overflow attack 
- an attacker can set up rogue DHCP server
    - DHCP: a user makes a DHCP request to the DHCP server/router. an attacker can return a DHCP acknowledgement more quickly than the real router. 
- an attacker can also set up a rogue ARP server. sets up man-in-the-middle attack. all traffic can go through this rogue server

ICN 8.3: Layer 3 attacks
- ICMP is used to convey info about the network to the source to indicate how it's doing. a router could use ICMP to tell the source that the destination was unreachable. 
- common types of attacks:
    - ICMP redirect messages
    - BGP hijacking
    -
